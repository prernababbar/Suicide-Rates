# Analyzing Worldwide Suicide Rates 

## Introduction:
Suicide is a worldwide problem that are affecting many countries in the world. With the rapid development of
socio-economic and growing GDP, it becomes a common issue and may affect anyone, any age or any gender
at any time.
Within this report, I review and analyze the dataset which captured the suicide number, gender, age group,
population and GDP values from 101 countries crossing over 3 decades from 1985 to 2016. My goal is to find key signals correlated to increased suicide rates among different cohorts globally, across the socio-economic spectrum. We get an overview of the global situation and then focus on North America, which are Canada, the United States and Mexico. The purpose is to get main key factors that cause high suicide rate, predict the trends and support the prevention services of suicides.

## Data Source:
Source: Suicide Rates Overview 1985 to 2016
(Compares socio-economic info with suicide rates by year and country)

## Hypothesis:
● With the high speed of socio-economic growth of the last 30 years, a fast-paced lifestyle becomes
common in people’s daily life. People get higher pressure in this social circumstance and may cause
high chance of an increase in suicide rate.
● Adults in middle age (36 to 55 years) are stressful in daily life and may result in high suicides, since
they face high pressure from many aspects. For example, the kids who can't leave, can't find a job and
still need financial support, and aging parents who need more help than ever before. Also, competitive
pressure in the workplace is also increasing, as the update of knowledge and technology accelerates.
● Men have higher suicides than women since men are usually working outside and support family
expenses.
● People in developed countries may have higher suicides than people in developing countries.
● Suicides have differences or high rates in specific countries depending on the special culture and
traditional thoughts.

## Initial Assumptions: 
● The dataset only captured the year period from 1985 to 2016 for the majority of countries, the lack of
data from 2017 to current year 2020 may result in the prediction of suide rate different.
● With the data I am utilizing, I am not incorporating outside factors that may be affecting the suicide
rates. This may lead to a bias in the analysis.
● We are assuming a causational relationship initially. This may prove not to be true, or if it is true it may
not be properly represented in the analysis outcome.
● The results may be different depend on different analysis perspective and analysis skills
● Analysis results may have limitations based on how I group or organize data.

## Analysis Method:
Descriptive statistics, Autocorrelation time series, Linear Regression OLS model
